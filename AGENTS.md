# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (OpenCode, Claude Code, …) working in this
repository. `CLAUDE.md` only imports this file; edit this one.

**Planning Hub** is a dashboard web app that hosts estimation and planning
tools for Critical Manufacturing (CM) projects. It has a FastAPI server
(`src/server`) and a React SPA (`src/client`), shipped as two Docker images
and deployed to OpenShift with a Helm chart. User-facing documentation is in
`README.md`.

## What this is

The hub groups its tools by category (sidebar + home page cards, registered
in `src/client/src/lib/tools.ts`):

- **Estimations → Monte Carlo** (`/monte-carlo`). Forecasts how many
  sprints a team needs to reach a target (Items Resolved or Story Points) by
  running thousands of simulations sampled from historical sprint
  throughput. It reports P50/P70/P85/P95 confidence levels with completion
  dates (business days) and a histogram. Flow: choose a data source (Excel
  upload or Azure DevOps) → Data Input → Data Validation (optional) →
  Results. The statistics run on the server.
- **Planning → Release Plan** (`/release-plan`). An interactive board for
  planning which Epics/Features land in which milestone or sprint
  (drag-and-drop, table view, pivoted view). Boards are created from a JSON
  file or from Azure DevOps, can be synced from Azure DevOps, saved/loaded
  as JSON and exported to PNG. The board logic is client-only and
  autosaves to localStorage; the server is only used as the Azure DevOps
  proxy.

## Architecture

┌──────────────────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────────────────┐

│ React SPA static files       ├───────►│ FastAPI "Planning Hub API"   │
│ SPA fallback (try_files)     │        │ stateless, no database       │
└──────────────────────────────┘        └──────────────┬───────────────┘
                                                       │ REST (PAT from the request,
                                                       ▼ never stored; host allowlist)
                                                 Azure DevOps
```

- The **client** serves the SPA and proxies `/api/` to the server
  (`API_UPSTREAM`, default `http://server:8000`).
- The **server** is stateless: the SPA keeps all state (validated sprint
  summary, simulation results, Release Plan board) and sends what each
  request needs. Every 422 response is `{errors: [str]}`.
- **Azure DevOps** is reached only through the server
  (`/api/ado/*`). The Personal Access Token travels with each request and
  is never persisted; `ADO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` limits which hosts may be called.
- A diagram is also available in `docs/architecture.png`.

### Production workload (Helm)

`helm/chart` deploys to OpenShift (namespace `cm-planning-hub`):

- `cm-planning-hub-client-deployment` / `-service` and
  `cm-planning-hub-server-deployment` / `-service` (Services expose port 80
  → 8080 / 8000).
- `cm-planning-hub-ingress` routes `/api` → server and `/` → client at
  `public_http_address`.
- `values.yaml`: registry `dev.criticalmanufacturing.io`, image names, one
  shared `tag` for both images, `adoAllowedHosts` (passed to the server as
  `ADO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`).

Both images run as non-root (OpenShift). Releases are built by the manual
**Deploy** GitHub workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`): GitVersion tag →
server and client tests + build → `deploy/build-docker-image.sh` (build and
push both images) → git tag.

### `specs/` and `plans/`

- **`specs/`** — the functional specification: *what* each tool must do. 
  This is the source of truth for behavior; read the relevant spec before changing a feature.
  `specs/templates/` is not committed — never import or read it.
- **`plans/`** — implementation plans, one per piece of work, with phases,
  checkboxes and *Phase Summaries*. They record *how* and *why* things were
  built (decisions agreed with the user, API contracts, edge cases) that
  cannot be re-derived from the code. Key ones:
  - `monte-carlo-app.md` — "Key decisions": simulation/validation business
    rules (ranking, percentiles, the `>50` sprints sentinel, business days).
  - `release-plan-board.md`, `release-plan-import-export.md`, `release-plan-ado.md` — Release Plan features reference.

  When working on a plan, follow its "For Future Agents" section (tick
  checkboxes, update phase status, write the Phase Summary). New multi-step
  work gets a new plan (see the `real-work` skill).

### Server — `src/server`

Python 3.12, FastAPI, pandas/NumPy, httpx.

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `app/main.py` | App factory: mounts routers under `/api` and `/api/ado`, converts validation errors to `{errors}`. |
| `app/config.py` | Settings from the environment (`ADO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `ADO_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`). |
| `app/schemas.py` | Pydantic request/response models — the API contract. |
| `app/api/routes.py` | Monte Carlo: `GET /health`, `POST /validate`, `POST /simulate`. |
| `app/api/ado_routes.py` | Azure DevOps proxy: `POST /ado/connect`, `/ado/backlog`, `/ado/sprint-history`. |
| `app/services/` | All business logic (routes stay thin): `validation` (form guardrails), `data_processing` (Excel parsing, sprint summary), `simulation` + `forecast` (vectorized NumPy Monte Carlo, percentiles, dates, histogram), `ado_*` (ADO client, URL rules, backlog and sprint-history reads). |
| `tests/` | pytest suite (unit, route, end-to-end incl. performance limits). |

### Client — `src/client`

Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind 3, react-router, Vitest. Code is
organized **per tool** (`monteCarlo/`, `releasePlan/`, shared `ado/`), with
shared hub pieces at the top level.

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx` | Entry point and routes. |
| `src/pages/` | One component per route (`monteCarlo/` subfolder for its wizard). |
| `src/components/` | Shared hub UI (layout, sidebar, toasts, dialogs, icons) plus per-tool folders `monteCarlo/`, `releasePlan/`, `ado/`. |
| `src/lib/` | Non-UI logic. `tools.ts` = tool registry (add a tool here + routes in `App.tsx`). Per tool: `types.ts` + `api.ts` mirror the server schemas; `releasePlan/` holds the pure board logic (validation, reducer, layout, storage, export). |
| `src/monteCarloStore.tsx`, `src/releasePlanStore.tsx` | Per-tool state (React context). Monte Carlo is in memory only; Release Plan autosaves to localStorage. |
| `src/test/` | Test helpers and fixtures (`render.tsx` → `renderAt`, DnD/canvas mocks). |
| `Dockerfile`, `nginx.conf.template` | Build → nginx-unprivileged image, `/api` proxy. |

## Development workflow and subagents

Three subagents are defined in `.claude/agents/` (Claude Code). OpenCode
uses the same files through per-file symlinks in `.opencode/agents/`
(OpenCode does not follow a symlinked directory). Edit them only in
`.claude/agents/`, and when adding an agent also add its symlink:
`ln -s ../../.claude/agents/<name>.md .opencode/agents/<name>.md`. Each
file carries both Claude (`name`, `tools`) and OpenCode (`mode`,
`permissions`) frontmatter.

| Subagent | Area | Writes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `backend-developer` | `src/server`, `specs/` | Python changes + **unit tests** only |
| `frontend-developer` | `src/client`, `specs/` | React/TS changes + **unit tests** only |
| `qa-engineer` | review of the change, tests, `specs/` | **integration / end-to-end tests** only; never production code |

The **main session is the coordinator**: it plans, delegates, verifies and
reports. For any feature or fix that changes `src/server` or `src/client`:

1. **Plan** — read the request, the relevant `specs/` and `plans/`. Split
   the work into a backend task and a frontend task. If the change crosses
   the API, write the API contract once (route, request/response shapes,
   422 `{errors: [str]}` cases) and give the identical contract to both
   developers. Record a baseline (`git status --short` and the current
   pass/fail state of the verification commands) so pre-existing failures
   are not blamed on, or hidden by, this work. In a fresh worktree run
   `cd src/client && npm ci` first.
2. **Develop** — launch `backend-developer` and `frontend-developer` **in
   parallel** (one message, two subagent calls). Give each: the user's goal,
   its own task, the shared API contract, the relevant spec sections and the
   files you expect it to touch. Skip an agent only if its side clearly
   needs no change. When both finish, **re-run the verification commands
   yourself** — never advance on an agent's word alone. Exit criteria:
   server compiles and its tests pass; client build (type-check) and tests
   pass; each developer added/updated unit tests for its change and no
   integration/e2e tests; changes stay in each agent's area
   (`git diff --stat`). On failure, send the output back to the responsible
   developer and re-verify. Never move on with a red build or test.
3. **QA** — only after Develop passes, launch `qa-engineer` with the goal,
   the API contract, the changed files (`git diff --stat` against the
   baseline) and the relevant specs. It reviews against specs and best
   practices, adds **integration / end-to-end tests**, never changes
   production code, and reports Blocker / Major / Minor findings. Exit
   criteria: no open Blocker/Major findings, and the full verification
   commands still pass (re-run them yourself).
4. **Fix loop** — send each Blocker/Major finding back to the responsible
   developer, re-verify the Develop exit criteria, then re-run QA in full.
   At most 3 Develop ↔ QA cycles; if defects remain, stop and report to the
   user. Minor findings don't block; list them in the final report.
5. **Wrap up** — update the plan (checkboxes, Phase Summary), including
   docs (`AGENTS.md`, `README.md`) when the architecture or usage changed.
   Report per phase: agents used, files changed, tests added (unit vs.
   integration/e2e), verification results, Develop ↔ QA iterations and
   outstanding minor findings. Don't commit unless asked.

While coordinating, the main session does not write production code or
tests itself, and uses the shell only for verification (tests, builds,
`git diff`, `git status`) — never to commit, push or stash.

Verification commands (all must pass):

```bash
python3 -m compileall -q src/server/app
python3 -m pytest src/server -q
cd src/client && npm run build && npm test -- --run
```

## Commands

```bash
# Full stack (http://localhost:8080; from inside the devcontainer use http://172.17.0.1:8080)
docker compose up --build
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.debug.yml up --build   # server under debugpy (5678)

# Server
cd src/server && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
cd src/server && pytest                                   # all tests
cd src/server && pytest tests/test_simulation.py          # one file
cd src/server && pytest tests/test_validate_route.py::<name>   # one test

# Client
cd src/client && npm ci && npm run dev    # http://localhost:5173, proxies /api -> :8000
cd src/client && npm test -- --run        # Vitest
cd src/client && npm run build            # tsc -b type-check + production build

# Docker images (normally done by the "Deploy" GitHub workflow; run from repo root)
./deploy/build-docker-image.sh -t <tag> --no-push            # build both images
./deploy/build-docker-image.sh -t <tag> -u <user> -p <pat>   # build + push both
```

Environment notes:

- The devcontainer provides Python 3.12 (`.venv`) and Node 22. If `node` is
  missing: `export PATH=~/.local/node/bin:$PATH`.
- Docker is docker-outside-of-docker: published ports are reachable at
  `172.17.0.1:<port>`, not `localhost`. If attached `docker run` drops
  stdout, use `docker run -d --name x ...; docker wait x; docker logs x`.
- `helm`, `actionlint`, `shellcheck` aren't installed; run them via the
  `alpine/helm`, `rhysd/actionlint`, `koalaman/shellcheck` images.
- No linter is configured; `npm run build` is the client type-check.
- Add npm dependencies with `npx npm@11 install` (npm 10 can't resolve
  vitest 4's peer deps from scratch; `npm ci` with npm 10 is fine).
- The root `.gitignore` ignores `lib/`; `src/client/.gitignore` re-includes
  `src/lib/`.
